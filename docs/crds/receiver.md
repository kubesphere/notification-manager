# Receiver

## Overview

`Receiver` is used to define the notification format and destinations to which notifications will be sent.
`Receiver` can be categorized into 2 types `global` and `tenant` by label like `type = global`, `type = tenant` :
- A global receiver receives all notifications and then send notifications regardless tenant info(user or namespace).
- A tenant receiver only receives notifications from the namespaces that the tenant has access to.

A receiver resource allows the user to define:

- [dingtalk](#DingTalk-Receiver)
- [email](#Email-Receiver)
- [feishu](#Feishu-Receiver)
- [pushover](#Pushover-Receiver)
- [slack](#Slack-Receiver)
- [sms](#SMS-Receiver)
- [webhook](#Webhook-Receiver)
- [wechat](#WeChat-Receiver)

## How to select config

The `Receiver` defines where to send notifications, and the [Config](config.md) define how to send notifications to receiver.
A `Receiver` selects a `Config` by `xxxConfigSelector`.

The relationship between receivers and configs can be demonstrated as below:

![Receivers & Configs](../images/receivers_configs.png)

For a tenant receiver, it will use the config selector to select config if config selector has been set, else it will try to find a `default` config.
For a global receiver, it can only use default config.

## Notification filter

A receiver can only receive the notifications it needs by setting `alertSelector`. The `alertSelector` is label selector,
the receiver will only receive the notifications that match the selector.

An email receiver only receives "warning" notifications.

```yaml
email:
  alertSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: serverity
        operator: In
        value:
          - error
          - critical
```

An email receiver only receives cluster-level notifications.

```yaml
email:
  alertSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: namespace
        operator: DoesNotExist
```
